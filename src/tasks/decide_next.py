"""decide_next task.

Runs on every wake after Wake 1. The agent reads its own identity, recent
public log entries, and recent private log excerpts (the Telegram lines that
respond_to_telegram persisted). It then asks the model for one JSON object
containing reasoning (private), a public_summary, an optional private
Telegram message to the operator, and up to three optional web search queries.

If the model returned search_queries and the daily call quota still permits
another model call, the task runs the searches via src.web_search, formats
the results, and calls the model a second time to produce final public and
private outputs. Otherwise call 1's outputs are used.

Each produced public string is run through the style guard. Reasoning is
private only and is never style-checked. Raw model output is appended to the
private log and never written anywhere public.

Dispatch is defensive: any sub-action that fails becomes a status line in the
private summary while the wake still returns the parts that worked.
