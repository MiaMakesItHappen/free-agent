"""reflect_and_name task.

Wake 1 only. The agent picks a name for itself, writes a short self-statement
in its own voice, anchors its directive, publishes a first public introduction
to the public feed, and (when a Telegram chat exists) sends a first private
message to the operator.

If no language model is available on Wake 1, the agent writes a placeholder
identity and tries again next wake. The task never raises out to the
orchestrator; every error path returns a TaskResult.
